 <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

 With the covid19 virus it became apparent that there is a need for Home Monitoring. Doctors noted severe damage in patients' lungs, even when the patient had no symptoms. Also the oxygen saturation was shocking for most.
 With this project we would like to make sure people have an option to measure their saturation at home when they have corona but are too healthy to stay in the hospital.
 In this way we hope to avoid the worst by noticing in time what's going on.
